## 📍 Getting Here {#getting-here}

### Planning your trip
- Download the app “DB navigator”. This gives you the most accurate train schedules, and you can purchase your train tickets directly on the app. *Google Maps can be unreliable*
- You can use the website bahn.de as well if you have trouble installing the app and get a your ticket at a machine at the station
- The train station closest to the house is called “Gräfenhainichen”
- The bus station closest to the house is called “Zschornewitz Lehrwerkstatt”
- You’re more likely to see ICE/IC (InterCity /Express, fast trains) connections, they are more expensive
- To see cheaper regional trains, under the search options uncheck “show fastest connection”
- If you see a “Rufbus” on your connection (calling bus), the bus only goes if it has been called for (after 17h and on the weekends). Make plans with the roommates to pick you up from the train station or make a reservation with the Rufbus (see below)

Please help yourself to anything in the fridge. If there's anything you would like from the shop, add it to the grocery list (check the fridge). We usually cook one group meal per day in the evenings.

#### Trash
Please sort your trash :) There’s an overview on the kitchen wall. When you’ve mastered recycling in Germany you’ll be granted moral citizenship automatically.

- Trash ("Restmüll") &rarr; **Kitchen**
- Recyling (packaging, no leftovers) &rarr; **Kitchen**
- Paper (no handkerchiefs) &rarr; **Kitchen**
